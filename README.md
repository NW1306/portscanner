A port scanner is a tool used to identify open ports and services available on a networked device. Here's a breakdown of how it typically works:

Purpose: The primary objective of a port scanner is to determine which ports on a target device are open and listening for connections. This can reveal potential vulnerabilities in the system.

How it Works:

The scanner sends a request to each port in a specified range on the target device's IP address.
The response helps determine if the port is open, closed, or filtered by a firewall.
Scanning Process:

The port scanning process generally involves creating a socket for network communication.
A timeout value is set to manage how long the scanner waits for a response from a port before moving on. A shorter timeout can lead to less accuracy, whereas a longer timeout can provide more accurate results.
If the scanner successfully connects to a port, it often attempts to retrieve the banner, which can give information about the software or service running on that port.
Output:

The scanner will typically output a list of open ports along with any banners it manages to retrieve. If a port is closed, it generally does not report that, focusing instead on identifying active services.
Limitations: It's important to note that while port scanning can identify which services are exposed, it doesnâ€™t inherently indicate if those services are vulnerable; additional testing is usually required to assess vulnerabilities.
